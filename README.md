MR Section Title
================

This module provides a block with a replacable string based on the first portion of the path
to the currently viewed page. It uses the [String Overrides module](https://drupal.org/project/stringoverrides) 
to provide a configurable interface for controlling the text to be displayed for each path segment base.

There is example code in template.example.php for how to provide an optional field override 
to set the section title on a page-specific basis.
